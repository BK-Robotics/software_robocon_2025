[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:13 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findrobot_interface.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "robot_interface", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "robot_interface"
  with any of the following names:

    robot_interfaceConfig.cmake
    robot_interface-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "robot_interface" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "robot_interface_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.
  If "robot_interface" provides a separate development package or SDK, be
  sure it has been installed.
